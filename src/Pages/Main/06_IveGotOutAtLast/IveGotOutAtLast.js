                            This is a work symbolizing the contents of the English-American literary novel Yellow Wallpaper. In the story, the heroine in the story is obsessed with the poisonous "Yellow Wallpaper." In particular, the yellow color may be scattered all over the place, and she may feel the yellow color as a smell. I put a yellow typo on the entire background to make  obsession with Yellow a typo. First of all, I think the scene of Yeoju tearing down the yellow wallpaper and meeting herself in there is the essence of the novel. The scene portrays the heroine in the story opposition to "men" that were the vested interests of the time and the stereotype image of "women" created by men in that she was exploring herself, not the femininity infused by men.<br></br><br></br>

Not only that, but it was also a scene of her opposition to "reason," "doctor" (a professional job), and "self-control" that vested interests regarded as some of the central values for "male" at the time. It is also a scene that highlights the importance of values such as "emotion," "imagination," and "women's free will" that were considered negative at the time. So on the left, I put an image that symbolizes the heroine in the story tearing the Yellow wallpaper and finding her own identity, escaping the world of existing vested interests. It is an image of the typographic work "I've got out at last," protruding between the "Yellow typographic work" filling the background.<br></br><br></br>

In the poster on the right, the yellow elements in the entire background are made to form "I've got out at last" between dark and small yellow typographic work. The sentence is composed of large fonts, and the space between the letters is adjusted so that the overall layout is brought to life. the heroine in the story is also obsessed with the words "to crawl," which means how she could become free. So I included the words as part of typographic work. In the same sense, I included "I woke up" as a symbol of the heroine in the story finding her identity. As part of the overall layout, this sentence is also made in bold and large size. By doing so, together with "I've got out at last," the overall layout was given a lively effect. <br></br><br></br>

Also, the black patterns that look like graffiti express the insane environment and the heroine in the story hysterical mental state.
